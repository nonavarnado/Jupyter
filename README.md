Slightly random assortment of Jupyter notebooks from UCI Earth Systems Science undergrad.

Plus a selection of thinking through some things/process notebooks exploring the idea of how to advance finding areas of interest and correlations in large 4D climate model datasets, via BVOC concentration as affected by ch4, o3 and other variables. Currently it is a long and time consuming process to run a variable analysis using either numerical stats (or potentially a visual 'heatmap'). The idea was initially to build a python tool to animate the pressure level concentrations so that a trained individual could quickly visually review 4D model runs to find areas of interest. It then occurred to me that this is a prime area to investigate how machine learning techniques can better facilitate this discovery process. A few months later the paper, "Advancing mathematics by guiding human intuition with AI" https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-021-04086-x was published successfully demonstrating this linkage of ideas. 

I am currently looking into machine learning opportunities to further pursue building a similar framework for climate model analysis.
